Customer Policy Data Analysis: Insights for Premium Discount Strategies (Using-PYTHON)

This project focuses on analyzing customer and policy data to assist a company in offering premium discounts to eligible customers. By cleaning and processing the data, key insights are extracted to support data-driven decisions.

The project consists of five major tasks:

1️⃣ Data Preparation & Column Naming

✅ Assign appropriate column names to both datasets: customer details and customer policy data.

2️⃣ Data Cleaning & Quality Check

✅ Handle missing values (replace with mean/mode, drop invalid IDs).

✅ Detect and treat outliers using the IQR method.

✅ Remove white spaces and apply case correction for uniformity.

✅ Convert categorical data into dummies for future modeling.

✅ Remove duplicate records to ensure data integrity.

3️⃣ Master Table Creation

✅ Merge customer details and customer policy tables using customer_id to create a master dataset.

4️⃣ Business Insights & Analysis

✅ Calculate average annual premium based on gender, age, and vehicle age.

✅ Check gender balance in the dataset to ensure fair representation.

5️⃣ Correlation Analysis

✅ Identify the relationship between a person's age and annual premium using correlation analysis to understand pricing patterns.

This data analysis project leverages Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib/Seaborn) to provide actionable insights for customer segmentation and premium optimization.
